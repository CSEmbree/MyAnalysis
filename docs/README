In this directory contains documentation for how to

documentation for the steering files you will need.

The steering files can documentation can be found in

  steering/

2. HOW TO MAKE A PLOT
======================================================
In general, to run the code to plot, run:

  ./plot MyCrossSectionSteeringFile.txt

where MyCrossSectionSteeringFile.txt contains paths to
a MyData Steering file, a MyGrid steering file, and any
option MyPDF steering files for theory convolutes.

An example of such a MyCrossSection steering file can
be found in the home project directory in the 'example'
directory and is called 'atlastest.txt'.

Run this example with

  ./plot example/atlastest.txt


======================================================
3. SUGGESTIONS
======================================================
Please read through all of the steering file documents
in the 'steering' directory.


======================================================
4. EXAMPLE(S)
======================================================
Try running the code with the steering files and grid
in the home project directory.

  ./plot example/atlastest.txt
